    "\n",
    "After a lot of trial and error, I’ve finally managed to **group and integrate varied job title keywords** that I had previously grouped into **14 distinct technical data science roles**. This was a huge step forward, as it now technically outlines the 14 job titles that will be used for the final MVP visualizations. The selection was made quite simply by looking at which careers are most representative of the data science industry thus requiring the title to have a certain number of job listings and title generality. To that end I attempted to group keywords by Discipline or Job Role and Career Growth Opportunies together to ensure that each category has at least **50 or more job listings**, making the visualizations much more meaningful.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Though the process wasn’t straightforward—by using a **hierarchical keyword-matching approach**, I was able to **sort job titles more accurately and move certain specialized roles** into their appropriate categories.\n",

    "### **Final EDA Steps: Experience & Seniority Classification**  \n",
    "\n",
    "With **job titles now standardized**, the next and final step in this **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) ticker 1.1** is to classify **experience and seniority levels**. Just like with job titles, this will involve:  \n",
    "\n",
    "- Spotting **patterns in experience-related keywords** (e.g., *Junior, Mid, Senior, Lead, Principal*).  \n",
    "- Making sure **job levels are assigned correctly** to maintain career progression.  \n",
    "- Avoiding **misclassification**, especially when job titles contain overlapping terms that could place them in the wrong category.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Once this step is complete, the dataset job title break down will be in **its cleanest, most structured form**, setting us up for **clear and reliable job market insight categorizations** in the final visualizations.  \n",

    "\n",
    "After extensive iterations and refinement, I’ve successfully classified **job titles and experience levels**, marking the completion of **Ticket 1.1 – EDA**. The final dataset consists of **5,079 classified job listings**, a significant improvement from the original **12,000+ entries**, effectively filtering out ambiguous or highly niche job titles that lacked meaningful representation.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I’m **proud of the classification rate**, especially given the complexity of long-form job titles and the overlapping nature of technical roles. By structuring job titles using a **hierarchical keyword-matching approach**, I was able to ensure that roles were grouped meaningfully while **minimizing misclassification and cross-contamination**. The addition of **seniority level classification** further enhances the dataset, allowing for better segmentation by career progression.  \n",
    "\n",
    "However, if I had more time, there are several areas I’d consider improving:  \n",
    "- **Handling slight misspellings or inconsistencies** in job titles, which may have led to some relevant listings being missed.  \n",
    "- **Exploring fuzzy matching techniques** to capture more variations in long-form job titles.  \n",
    "- **Refining the seniority classification process** to better differentiate between ambiguous roles (e.g., distinguishing between \"Lead\" and \"Senior\" when both appear in the same title).  \n",
    "- **Optimizing regex rules further** to ensure even more precise or better blanketed classification, particularly for niche roles that may still be underrepresented.  \n",
    "\n",
    "While this step concludes my **EDA for job title and experience level classification**, the next step is integrating this process into the **main data cleaning pipeline**, ensuring that future job postings are automatically categorized with minimal manual intervention. This structured approach lays the foundation for **more accurate and meaningful visualizations**, setting up the project for deeper insights into data science career paths.\n"
